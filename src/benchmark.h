    /// Most clocks guarantee that if two timestamps t1 and t2 were taken in
    /// succession, t2 cannot be "lesser than" t1 and therefore t2 - t1 must be
    /// a positive or zero duration. But this monotonicity property is
    /// unfortunately partially lost we attempt to compute true user code
    /// durations, i.e. the time that elapsed between the end of the now() at
    /// the beginning of a benchmark workload and the start of now() at the end
    /// of a benchmark workload. There are two reasons for this:
    ///
    /// - Computing the user workload duration requires us to subtract the clock
    ///   access delay, which is not perfectly known but estimated by
    ///   statistical means (and may indeed fluctuate one some uncommon hardware
    ///   configurations). If we over-estimate the clock access delay, then
    ///   negative duration measurements may happen.
    /// - Clocks do not guarantee that a timestamp will always be acquired at
    ///   the same time between the start and the end of the call to now(), and
    ///   this introduces an uncertainty window over the position of time
    ///   windows that can be as large as the clock access delay in the worst
    ///   case (though it will usually be smaller). If we take t the true
    ///   duration and dt the clock access time, the corrected duration `t2 - t1
    ///   - dt` may therefore be anywhere within the `[t - dt; t + dt]` range.
    ///   This means that in the edge case where `t < dt`, the computed duration
    ///   may also be negative.
    ///
    /// As a consequence of this, negative durations may pop up in intermediate
